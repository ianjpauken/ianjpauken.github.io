## The Mastermind: Review

`The Mastermind(2025) - Directed and Written By Kelly Reichardt` 

How hard could it be to pull off a heist? This is the question which pops off the story of Kelly Reichardt’s latest project ‘The Mastermind’. The curiosity sets in early as we are introduced to James Blaine Mooney and his family at the museum where the eventual art heist is destined to take place. But to start off the film, the opening scene is one that starts with action, a thrilling sequence of sly movements, helped by the coolness of Josh O’Connor’s slick performance. He steals a minifigure from the museum and with the help of some powerful jazz and an obsolete security, it feels like we have come across something as cinematic as a James Bond film. 

‘The Mastermind’ is set sometime between the 60s and 70s, we never really know for sure exactly when until it’s too late in an ending which has its time period swallow James whole. The opening sequence is a great set-up for the immediate trust we have in our cinematic protagonists. The feeling that James has it all, he is a “Mastermind” of all possible hijinx. But, just like the people in James’ life, your trust in him eventually wavers. You follow through the fall throughs of James in hilarious fashion. But by the end, you feel as broken down and given up with the life of James and fall out of love with this drifter. James has failed too often and bad habits have been repeated too often. The life of this failed schemer seems allegorical to the life of a failed artist at times but it's better to feel it for yourself than for me to describe it. ‘The Mastermind’ is a film that I have kept mostly secret but if you want to experience a heist unlike any other and one of the best comedies of the year while simultaneously having your heart broken, please check out ‘The Mastermind.’
